<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>Hi! Thank you for taking the time to look at my page. </p>
<p> I'm Hollis Kuang, a first-generation college graduate. I currently work as a Management Consultant based out
 of San Francsico. When I'm not thinking about the bottom line, I am most likely

 style='color:orange'>m</span><span style='color:red'>i</span><span style='color:green'>n</span><span 
 style='color:indigo'>g</span>.

binary. That is why I code.</p>
