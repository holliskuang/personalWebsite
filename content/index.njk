<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>Hi! Thank you for taking the time to look at my page. </p>
<p> I'm Hollis Kuang, a first-generation college graduate. I currently work as a Management Consultant based out
 of San Francsico. When I'm not thinking about the bottom line, I am most likely 
 <span style='color:red'>p</span><span style='color:blue'>r</span><span style='color:green'>o</span><span style='color:cyan'>g</span><span 
 style='color:orange'>a</span><span style='color:indigo'>m</span><span 
 style='color:orange'>m</span><span style='color:red'>i</span><span style='color:green'>n</span><span 
 style='color:indigo'>g</span>. 
  I also exercise . . . sometimes, every now and then, when I get the chance.   </p>

<p> I think a lot about the beauty and complexity of what we are able to derive out of simple 
binary. That is why I code.</p>
<p>

<h3>From Humble Beginnings</h3>
<p> My first programming language was  <img

 now take the course are forced to use IntelliJ. Throughout the semester, I was able to uncover the optimal solution to the elusive Traveling Salesman Problem
 but not what <span style='color:green'>public</span>
  <span style='color:red'>static</span>
   <span style='color: blue'>void</span>
    <span style='color: purple'>main(<span style='color:orange'>String[]</span> <span style='color:cyan'>args</span>)</span> meant. </p>
<p>Eventually, I learned about dynamically typed languages like Javascript and thought that I was saved. But nowaways, I find myself using the strongly-typed versions of weakly-typed languages.
 It's funny how things work out. Thank you Microsoft! </p>
<p>On that note, I love the Open Source Communnity that you can find in progamming. It's what keeps me coding. It's a culture of collaboration
and selflessness that you will rarely find anywhere else. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp	 And it is beautiful in a way, how interconnected the world wide web is because of these very
principles. It inspires me and makes me hope that one day, I can also contribute back to this community which I have gained so much knowledge from.
